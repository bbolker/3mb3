    "4\\. Evaluate the equilibria and conditions for stability of this model. Compare the equilibria and stability conditions to those for the standard logistic (i.e. when $\\theta=1$).  How does $\\theta$ affect the population growth rate when rare (rate of departing from the zero equilibrium)?  How does it affect the stability of the non-zero equilibrium (i.e. for what values of $\\theta$ is it more, less, or equally stable?) [here \"more stable\" would mean a negative Jacobian of larger magnitude; \"less unstable\" would mean a positive Jacobian of smaller magnitude; etc.]\n",
