    "Figures 1.5 to 1.7 in the book illustrate an example based on sandhill cranes. In the simplest version of this model, the crane population changes according to $C(t+1)=(1+r)C(t)$. A variant of the model adds [hacking](http://www.ccbbirds.org/what-we-do/research/species-of-concern/peregrine-falcon/virginia-hacking/), i.e. an addition of a constant number of birds per year to the population. (As in the example above, the birds are assumed to be added *after* the proportional gain or loss, i.e $C(t+1)=(1+r) C(t) +h$. Create a *single* plot for each of the following cases; in each case include a legend and axis labels. **Please use for loops to create the information for your graphs, not the analytical solution given above.** (If you are an overachiever and want to include both the analytical and the computational solution, that's fine.)\n",
