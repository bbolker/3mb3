Basic model: $\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = f(x(t))$. For example, $f(N) =
rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$ is the logistic model in continuous time.
    
\section*{Fixed points and stability}

In general, as usual, fixed points are found by setting $\frac{dx}{dt}
= f(x) = 0$ and solving for $x$. A fixed point $\xstar$ is stable if
$f'(\xstar) < 0$, because this ensures that the state will return to
$\xstar$ for sufficiently small perturbations from $\xstar$.

\qq{Which points are stable?} \qq{Why?}

\subsection*{Example: logistic model}


There are two solutions to $f(\Nstar) = 0 =
r\Nstar(1-\frac{\Nstar}{K})$, which are $\Nstar = 0, K$. For
stability we evaluate $f'(N) = r(1-\frac{2N}{K})$ at the fixed
points. $f'(0) = r$ and $f'(K) = -r$. Therefore, if $r > 0$, the fixed
point at zero is unstable whereas that at $K$ is stable. \qq{How do
  these stability properties compare with discrete time?}

\subsection*{Example: constant harvest model}

$f(N) = rN(1-\frac{N}{K}) - h$. Fixed points obey,
$-\frac{r}{K}(\Nstar)^2 + r\Nstar - h = 0$. Using the quadratic
formula $\Nstar = \frac{-r \pm \sqrt{r^2 -
    r(\frac{-r}{K})(-h)}}{2(\frac{-r}{K})}$. A non-dimensional form is
easier to understand. Let $\nu = \frac{h}{rK}$ be a dimensionless
harvest rate and $n = \frac{N}{K}$ be a dimensionless state
variable. This yields $f(n) = r(n(1-n)-\nu)$. Fixed points, $\nstar
= \frac{1}{2}(1 \pm \sqrt{1-4\nu})$. If $\nu > 1/4$ there are no FPs,
with $\nu = 1/4$ there is one FP ($\nstar = 1/2$), and with $\nu <
1/4$ there are two. For stability: $f'(n) = r(1-2n)$, $f'(\nstar) =
\mp r\sqrt{1-4\nu}$. \qq{Why did the $\pm$ sign change to $\mp$?}
\qq{Draw a picture to help understand this model.}

\section*{Time-dependent solution}

Two approaches: (1) general solution using differential
equation methods or (2) simulate special cases using numerical
methods.

\subsection*{General solutions}

A more general model is $g(x,\frac{dx}{dt},\frac{d^2x}{dt^2},...) =
f(t)$. In this class we will only be doing general solutions for
first-order homogeneous (i.e. $f(x) = \frac{dx}{dt}$) and first-order
non-homogeneous (i.e. $f(x,t) = \frac{dx}{dt}$).

For homogeneous we go back to the logistic, which can be done with
separation of variables. $\frac{dN}{N(1-\frac{N}{K})} = r\, dt$. Using
the partial fractions trick the left hand side is $\frac{dN}{N} +
\frac{dN}{K-N}$. \qq{Check my work!} The indefinite integrals are
$\int \frac{dN}{N} = \log(N) + C$, $\int \frac{dN}{N-K} = -\log(N-K) +
C$, and $r\int dt = rt + C$. \qq{Finish the job.} For non-homogeneous
check out the drugs in the body example (Mooney and Swift p. 252).

\subsection*{Numerical solutions}

The simplest approach is \emph{Euler's method}: convert into a difference
equation. There is a trade-off here: if you make the step-size too
large the approximation will be poor, but if you make the step-size
too small computations will take a long time (watch out for
computation times longer than the age of the universe!). Although
Euler's method is easy to understand, In general you are better off
using smarter software (e.g. \texttt{scipy.integrate.odeint})

\section*{Example:  plant and animal growth}

Start with a conservation of energy law \cite{kooijman_dynamic_2000}
\begin{equation*}
  B = B_c N_c + E_c \frac{dN_c}{dt}
\end{equation*}
$B$, rate of energy intake (e.g. via food); $B_c$, rate of intake
required to maintain a single cell; $N_c$, number of cells; $E_c$,
energy required to create a new cell. By (1) defining $m$ and $m_c$ as
the masses of the entire organism and of a single cell, and (2) using
the empirical relationship, $B = am^b$ (constants $b\approx 3/4$ and
$a$), we have a differential equation for the mass of an organism
\qq{(derive this),}
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{dm}{dt}  = \underbrace{\frac{a m_c m^b}{E_c}}_{\text{supply}} - 
  \underbrace{\frac{B_c m}{E_c}}_{\text{demand}}
\end{equation*}
When the supply of energy exceeds the demand, the organism can grow
(\qq{sketch the supply and demand curves}).  There is a trivial fixed
point at $\mstar = 0$ and an interesting one at $\mstar =
\left(\frac{am_c}{B_c}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-b}}$.  Note equilibrium mass is larger
for organisms with cells that are larger and have smaller energy
requirements. Interestingly, the equilibrium mass is independent of
the energy required to make a new cell, $E_c$ (although it does
influence the rate of approach to equilibrium).

Time dependent solution can be found by a change of variables $\mu = 1
- \left(\frac{m}{\mstar}\right)$, which leads to a simple exponential
decay model (note that $\mu$ is dimensionless).  By the chain rule,
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{d\mu}{dt} = \left(\frac{dm}{d\mu}\right)^{-1} \frac{dm}{dt}
\end{equation*}
By finding the derivative $\frac{dm}{d\mu}$ and substituting in the
new variable for $n$ into the differential equation above we have,
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{d\mu}{dt} = -a (\mstar)^{b-1} (1 - b) \mu
\end{equation*}
This is a simple exponential decay model, which you can solve \qq{(do
  it and back transform to get the time dependent solution for $m$).}

More generally, this is an example of
