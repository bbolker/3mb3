## Philosophy

Modeling is *applied* math; mapping between the real world and mathematical framework.
Getting the mapping right is the hardest part. "All models are wrong"
(attr. George Box): want an **approximate** solution to the right question,
rather than an exact solution to a different question.
@platt_strong_1964: ``you can catch phenomena in a logical box or
in a mathematical box. The logical box is coarse but strong.
The mathematical box is fine-grained but flimsy.  The mathematical
box is a beautiful way of wrapping up a problem, but it will not
hold the phenomena unless they have been caught in a logical box
to begin with.''

What is a 'simulation'?

**Criteria**: generality, realism, precision [@levins_strategy_1966].
"The validation of a model is not that it is 'true' but that it generates
good testable hypotheses relevant to important problems" (or sufficiently accurate predictions?) ($\approx$ ``useful'')?

**Limits**: data, analytical tractability, computation, human comprehension?

@odenbaugh_strategy_2006: "The premature use of numerical methods (especially computer methods) can often confuse numbers with knowledge."

## Tools

- Spreadsheets:
    - intuitive, visible, auto-updating
    - hard to reproduce, non-transparent, numerically sloppy, often closed-source
- Programming languages (R, Python, MATLAB/Scilab)
    - free and open (some), flexible, extendable, widely used
    - harder to learn, somewhat limited for big data, no support/arrogant
- Analytical solutions
    - general, rigorous, computationally efficient
    - very hard (*closed-form* solutions sometimes impossible)

## modeling choices

- linear / nonlinear
- univariate / multivariate
- discrete / continuous time
- deterministic / stochastic
- *also*: discrete / continuous state, individual- / population-based ...

e.g. LUDD, MUDS, ...
