	abstract = {Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) famously said that, “whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.” Although his counsel was given in a specific context, it is actually good general advice that Chris Anderson, Editor‐in‐chief of Wired magazine, would do well to heed. On June 23, 2008, Anderson posted an article on Wired's website, “The end of theory: the data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete,” from which it is perfectly clear that he doesn't understand much about either science or the scientific method.

Anderson's main point is that the modern era of ‘petabyte’ information and ‘cloud’ computing on the web is bypassing the ‘hypothesize, model, test’ procedure of science because scientific theorizing simply cannot cope with the deluge of data. Here is an excerpt: “Out with every theory of human behavior, from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology, and psychology. Who knows why people do what they do? The point is they do it, and we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity […] the numbers speak for themselves.” Actually, the point may or may not be why people do things as opposed to what they do—it just depends …},

	abstract = {Abstract Climate change could profoundly affect the status of agricultural insect pests. Several approaches have been used to predict how the temperature and precipitation changes could modify the abundances, distributions or status of insect pests. In this article it is demonstrated how the use of simple models, such as Ricker’s classic equation, including a mechanistic representation of the influence of exogenous forces may improve our predictive capacity of the dynamic behaviour of insect populations. Using data from classical experiments in population ecology, we evaluate how temperature and humidity influence the density of two stored grain insect pest, Tribolium confusum and Callosobruchus chinensis , and then, using the A2 and B2 scenarios proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the previous modelling, we develop predictions over the future pest status of T. confusum along South America austral region, and specifically for eight cities in the continental Chilean territory. Tribolium confusum and C. chinensis show qualitatively different responses to the exogenous forcing of temperature and humidity, respectively. Our simulations predict a change in the equilibrium density of T. confusum from 10 to 14\% under the moderate B2 scenario and 12 to 22\% under the extreme A2 scenario to the period, 2071–2100. Both results imply a severe change in the pest status of this species in the southern region. This study illustrates how the use of theoretically based models may improve our predictive capacity. This approach provides an opportunity to examine the link between invasive species and climate change and how new suitable habitat may become available for species whose niche space is limited in some degree by climatic conditions. The use of different scenarios allows us to examine the sensitivity of the predictions, and to improve the communication with the general public and decision-makers; a key aspect in integrated pest management.},

This definition forms the common theme for our review of approaches for demonstrating the importance of chaos in ecology. We emphasize that this definition of chaos can include the effects of noise, and that there is no dichotomy between stochasticity and chaos. We review three classes of approaches for studying chaos in ecology: models, analysis of time series, and experiments. Current ideas from modelling approaches demonstrate the plausibility of chaos. New approaches for analyzing time series are based on using the presence of a positive Lyapunov exponent to indicate sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The methods can deal with relatively short time series that include the effects of noise, with chaotic dynamics appearing in at least some cases. Experimental work is just beginning, spurred by modelling results and the new methods for analyzing times series. We suggest directions for further work in each of these approaches.},

	abstract = {This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples, and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors.A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with mathematical theory.In the twenty years since the first edition of this book appeared, the ideas and techniques of nonlinear dynamics and chaos have found application to such exciting new fields as systems biology, evolutionary game theory, and sociophysics. This second edition includes new exercises on these cutting-edge developments, on topics as varied as the curiosities of visual perception and the tumultuous love dynamics in Gone With the Wind.},

In developmental biology, an extraordinarily detailed understanding of fundamental genes and mechanisms has been built around a few core models including Drosophila, mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis, and zebrafish. The use of model species entails a series of epistemological issues and commitments regarding similarity, generalization, and the balance between representation and accessibility. In addition, the power of a given model is highly context-dependent, and the core models of developmental biology may not suffice for evo-devo questions. An epistemological perspective can clarify the complementary roles of standard and emerging models in evo-devo, as well as inform decisions about when new models are needed, and criteria for choosing them.},

All living organisms are covered in a single quantitative framework, the predictions of which are tested against a variety of experimental results at a range of levels of organisation. The theory explains many general observations, such as the body size scaling relationships of certain physiological traits, and provides a theoretical underpinning to the method of indirect calorimetry.

Tuberculosis is again becoming a problem because drug-resistant strains have evolved. Understanding the transmission characteristics of infectious diseases in communities, regions and countries can lead to better approaches to decreasing the transmission of these diseases. Mathematical models are useful in building and testing theories, and in comparing, planning, implementing and evaluating various detection, prevention, therapy and control programs.
