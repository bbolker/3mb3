## To do

- work on schedule
- are projects really going to be feasible in this space?
- find out about TA
- background knowledge poll [in class or for credit?]: programming languages, stats (optional), coursework, interests, career goals
- fix up GH pages

- correlate course list with 1mp03 rosters?

- presentations (6 periods = 300 min/15 groups = 20 minutes)

- Feys
    - web page https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~feysj/math3mb3.html
    - schedule http://ms.math.mcmaster.ca/~feysj/files2016/3MB3schedule2016.pdf
    - steal notes from Feys readings 

## To think about

- projects: Feys projects vs. ? Walker projects
     - my ideas: Yates et al 2007
     - non-biological examples???
     - stuff from R simulation book?
- Python/Jupyter vs R/Rmarkdown
- reference page/extras? 
- learn to read/reconstruct papers (see Feys papers ...)
- ways to facilitate discussion
- flipping: get students to read material *before* class?
- Fermi problems
- shiny app for cobwebbing?
- examples for discrete/continuous time discussion
- Borges (Carroll)

## In first notes
