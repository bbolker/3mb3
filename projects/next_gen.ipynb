    "The \"next-generation matrix\" approach is a formal method for deriving the intrinsic reproductive number ($\\rzero$) for an epidemic model. It is most useful when one wants a rigorous definition for $\\rzero$, especially in relatively complex epidemic models where the previous informal approach - identifying $\\rzero$ as the product of (1) the *per capita* rate of infection in a wholly susceptible population and (2) the duration of infection, where (1) and (2) are computed heuristically from the model definition - is insufficient. Some material taken from [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jhj1/teachingdocs/Jones-Epidemics050308.pdf), but modified/further explained. Notation follows van den Driessche and Watmough (2002).\n",

    "In general the next-generation matrix and the informal approach give identical answers. In models with multiple life stages (e.g. host-vector models or models of parasites with complex life cycles) there is an important distinction as to whether one counts the overall generation time as the *product* of the per-stage generation times ($g_{\\text{tot}} = \\prod_{i=1}^n g_i$) or their *geometric mean* ($g_{\\text{tot}} = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n g_i \\right)^{1/n}$). These definitions coincide at the invasion threshold ($\\rzero=1$), but differ away from it. When considering $1-1/\\rzero$ as the critical level of control, the important distinction is whether the intervention being considered interrupts all stages of transmission (e.g. bed nets keeping infected mosquitos from biting susceptible humans and *vice versa*) or only a single stage (e.g. an intervention that acts selectively on infected mosquitos).\n",
